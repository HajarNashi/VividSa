# Vivid Application

## Challenge

Develop an extraordinary idea for young people to feel comfortable expressing themselves through art, fostering a more connected community and linking them to the world around them.

## Solution

Vivid App aims to counteract the negative effects of technology-induced isolation by providing users with a means to engage with their surroundings in a more interactive manner. Leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) technology, users can draw and express themselves directly in the real world. This is complemented by a map feature highlighting locations with the most drawings, encouraging users to explore new places and step out of their comfort zones.
